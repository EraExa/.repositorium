## The Follow Reactive, Symbolic Meta-Programming Language-Suite

 1. Flow Language - Flow Commands:

 - Using Fractal Strings as Real and Permutations of the Imaginary Bases as Base, write strings of { Real | Base } or { ±1 | ±i | ±j | ±k } and when invoked with a data-set, generates entire Complex-Fractal Moduli-spaces of interest in Constraint Programming and Machine Learning.

 2. Action Language - Action Symbols:

 - Group Complex-Fractal Moduli-spaces into Elementary Symbolic Meta-Schemas, useful within Genetics Engineering and Machine Learning in order to set boundaries for the evolution of Neural Networks.

 3. Maneuver's Language - Maneuver Groups:

 - Group Action Symbols and Flow Commands into (not necessarily commutative) groups, useful to design Meta-Schemas and program causal links within not necessarily causal programs.

 4. United Language - United Interchange Schemas:

 - Boolean and Mathematical Arithmetics, and Meta-Schemas of the previous languages come together to form a pre-processing capable interchange language.

 5. Elite Language - Symbolical Assembler Programs:

 - Utilizing { mov | jmp | cmp }-denoted United Interchange Schemas, the Indeterminate Structuring Assembler is achieved, in where programs are grown from complementary mathematical structuring of the former languages and organically assemble into causal structures, ready for usage in the main interoperability language.

 6. Follower Language - Main Interoperability Language:

 - The Follower interoperability language is the main interoperability language of the Follow-Suite which combines the power of the complementary languages and the interoperability languages.

 7. Ether Language - Intermediate Representation Language:

 - Mitigate small-valued epsilon-delta correlations in your programs, finally compiling the project of multi-linguistic parts into a coherent cross-compilation friendly packaging.

# Speculative Trading meets Code Repositorium

An Open-Access Speculative Trading algorithm can be customized with one's own mathematical framework stored on-chain, amassing to Trading-bots combined with Trend Metrics.

A custom Programming Language (The Follow-suite) can be used to specify the complementary mathematical framework, tagging assets with abstract shapes to be used with moduli-spaces (grids) for taking actions based upon trend metrics within the grids.

## Part I: The Trading Algorithm.

 1. Assign N-length strings of Imaginary Base Permutohedrons to every Commodity you wish the Algorithm to trade with.

 2. Assert every Buy and Sell action as a Rotation (Unital Quaternion) of the Algebraic Structures created from these strings of permutations, evaluated at different time-discrete values within the market.

 3. Incorporate different N-length Permutohedrons for the different Volume-trends within the specific Commodities of which one would like the Algorithm to trade with.

 4. Multiply the Volume of each Buy/Sell action by this Rotation, resulting in a Proportionality Quaternion.

 5. Using Gradient-Descent, make the Gain-Algorithm favor the Zero-Sum Game of all Proportionality Quaternions when combined; being proportional to the Ratios within Buying Low, Selling High; and convert to Fiat-Currency whenever above a certain Threshold Value.

 - PS: The difficulity is making sure the Ratios of Buying Low and Selling High do not end up with a 100% Loss - This is impossible to ascertain within Speculative Trading Algorithms.

 - PSS: There is some guesswork involved, in creating the initial strings of permutations for the commodities and within making the resulting Algebraic Structures functional for trading.

## Part II: Implementing the Algorithm using Follow.

 - The keen eye will spot the similarities with the Flow Language, Action Language, Maneuvers Language and the United Interchange Language.

 - Flow Language is used to define the Imaginary Base Permutohedrons used.

 - Action Language is used to define the Moduli-Space of which denotes the Grids that the Algorithm should operate within.

 - Maneuvers Language is used to assert a certain set of Price Thresholds within the (for example) Logarithmical Grid-Boxes one wish the Algorithm to operate within.

 - United Interchange Language is then used for storage, finalizing the structure and readies it for usage in the Trading Bot.

## Part III: FollowDB Database Query and Entry.

 - The resulting United Interchange-Structure would behave like a Tensor-object, having at least one Contravariant Index and one Covariant Index (the Commodity Identifier and the Price of the Commodity, respectively).

 - One can furthermore define the Grid-boxes using a Symbolical Function specifying a Surreal-number; for both the amount of grid-boxes as well as for the relative grid-sizes (logarithmical, percentage-wise or otherwise).

 - Even still, is it possible to add more functionality to the Database Entry: By denoting each Tensor with an increased amount of Indices, it is possible to create a Flow-map of Sub-grid levels or to incorporate a Take Profit or Stop Losses mechanism.
